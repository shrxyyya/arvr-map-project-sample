# GeoNav

GeoNav is an immersive 2D-to-3D mapping navigation tool that allows users to seamlessly explore geographic locations in 2D and 3D. By clicking on any latitude and longitude on a 2D map, users are transported to a detailed 3D view of that area, where they can interact with the surroundings, such as buildings, streets, and other geographic features. Whether you're exploring new cities or reviewing architectural structures, GeoNav provides an immersive experience right from your browser!

## Key Features

- Seamless 2D to 3D Transition: Instantly switch from a 2D map to an interactive 3D view by clicking on any location.
- 3D Interactivity: Explore the 3D environment, interact with buildings, streets, and other geographic entities.
- Realistic 3D Rendering: Three.js renders the 3D maps with dynamic lighting and shadows, providing a highly realistic and immersive view.
- MapTiler Integration: Utilizes **MapTiler to create high-quality, customizable 2D and 3D maps with detailed topographical data.
- Easy Navigation: Navigate through the 3D environment using intuitive controls for smooth panning, zooming, and rotating.

## How It Works

1. Explore in 2D: Users start by interacting with a **2D map, powered by **MapTiler. Clicking on any location (latitude and longitude) triggers the transition to a **3D view of that area.

2. 3D Transition and Exploration: Once the user clicks, the map smoothly transitions to the 3D view of the selected location. Users can then explore the 3D environment, interacting with buildings, streets, and other features. The environment is rendered with **realistic lighting and shadows to enhance the immersion.

3. Zoom and Interact: In the 3D view, users can zoom in for a street-level view, rotate, and navigate to explore specific areas in detail. Interacting with entities like buildings allows for a more **immersive AR/VR-like experience.

## Technologies Used:
- MapTiler: Provides high-quality 2D and 3D maps, enabling the seamless transition between 2D and 3D views.
- Three.js: Powers the 3D rendering engine, providing smooth and immersive 3D navigation for an AR/VR experience.
- MapLibre GL JS: An open-source library used to handle the 2D-to-3D map rendering.
- GLTFLoader: Used for loading and rendering 3D models in GLTF format, which represent real-world objects (e.g., buildings, streets).
